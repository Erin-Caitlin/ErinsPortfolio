            <p class="lead">Here's a bit of background about myself: I graduated from Mondale High School in 2022, where I was first introduced to basic web development in Computer's Applications Technology. I received 99% in my last year of high school for our yearly Practical Assesment Task that included word documents, excel, database and designing an HTML website. Since then, my passion has driven me to pursue a career in software development.</p>

            <p class="lead">Over the past year, I've obtained a certificate for completing a 3-day photography course through RAD (Rise Above Development) and worked as a Customer Advisor at Sigma Connected (23rd March 2023 - 1st April 2024). In my time working at Sigma Connected, I was able to develop communication and interpersonal skills, along with the ability to work alone and various teams. As a driven and honest individual, I always strive to excel in any task that comes my way.</p>
            <p class="lead">Outside of my professional pursuits, I am a spiritual dancer with a lifelong passion, having started dancing in church at the age of 4 years old and attend the School of Esther, a monthly program that young girls can attend at church.</p>
            <p class="lead">I am currently a student at Life Choices Academy where I am completing a coding course. While I'm still a beginner, I'm commited to continuous learning and growth in the field. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled developer and make a meangingful impact in the industry and I'm excited to see what the future holds.</p>

            <p class="lead">In a world plagued by the influence of social media. It is quite rare that we are able to encounter something or rather someone who is true in their very nature and who under no circumstances conforms to the ways of the world. This description is exactly who Erin Williams is. A young lady who in all excellency, remains true to her very nature, remaining firm in her beliefs and values. Who does not compromise with truth, and living her life in love and compassion. Erin's greatest attribute is her ability to connect with others, creating a safe space for others to be themselves, yet not compromising on who she is. Erin is filled with wisdom, humility and a consistent drive to excel in all that she does. Her attributes have been portrayed in every area in her life. Allowing her to achieve great accomplishments. Erin is an inspiration to those around her, amongst her own peers and even those who distantly admires her. She is able to achieve anything she sets her mind to, as she exhibits true resilience. Erin is more than capable of achieving greatness and being a success in multiple facets.

            <p class="lead">Erin Williams has been a longstanding member of the Deep River Revival Worship Center.
              As her pastor, I have seen many examples of her tenacity and leadership capabilities. She has proven
              herself to be a diligent, purpose driven person of high values and etiquette. While she may have had
              challenges as any young person does, she did not let this deter her from focusing on her goals and
              pursuing them with tenacious drive.</p>
              <p class="lead">Erin has shown moral character and sound principles when making life decisions, as guided by

              <p class="lead">She is a committed team player and has shown herself capable of receiving and acting on instructions
              without protest or delay. I eagerly recommend her for any position she may apply and know she will act
              with the best interest of the organization at heart, by adding value to the team she is working with.
